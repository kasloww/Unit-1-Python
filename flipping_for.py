Exercise 1:

"""
nah = "string"
for a in nah:
    print(a)
# The amount of times the variable printed was becuse of how much letters were in the string so yes I did expect it
# made a variable and assigned a value to it then another varible being made because of the for loop and prints the amount of value the variable has to it

Exercise 2:
Write a program to calculate the sum of elements in a list using a for loop.
"""
add = [7,17,18,21]
sum = 0
for num in add:
    sum += num
    print("The sum of the list is:", sum)
# I didn't expect it to come out like this, I thought it was going to add up every number together not every other number
# First variable holds all numbers and the sum += num code makes every number add onto each other
